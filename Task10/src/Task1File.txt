There, are a lot of blue rivers and lakes on the Earth.
Its oceans are full of wonders.
The sun shines high up in the blue sky.
At night we can see the moon and millions of stars.
One season comes after another and brings changes in weather and nature.
There are so many wonderful places to visit and interesting things to see.
Nature gives people its riches to live and enjoy.
That is why we must take care of it.
We must keep our rivers and lakes, forests and towns clean.
We must take care of each plant and each animal.
We must plant flowers not pick them up, feed birds and animals in winter not kill them.
